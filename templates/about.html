    <h1>Alexia Barrows</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Alexia Barrows, a third-year Computer Science student with an interest in web development. I'm particularly intrigued about front-end development as I like the idea of buliding interactive, user-friendly interfaces. I'm also interested in exploring back-end development to improve on full-stack capabilities and dip my foot in the water with functional web applications. My goal is to become a rounded web developer. </p>
